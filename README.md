# CSUS_Senior_Project
My CSUS (csus.org) senior project with a goal to learn more about databases and webpage development.

The included work was written from April 2017 - June 2017 for a high school senior project. 
The objective was to look into web design as well as data management with research on online databases.
The result was a website that allowed automated creation of pages for a survey website intended to streamline surveys throughout the school.

The python files were created to make new webpages (HTML base with a PHP mirror) that would accept user input. 
The other files in this directory were used as the base pages for the website (e.g. index.html is the landing page).
